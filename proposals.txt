Adaptively I make up on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript according to the design layout in figma for all popular devices and browsers.

I type using gulp, scss, JavaScript.

Typesetting:

-validation in the W3C validator
-checking optimization in google pagespeed insights
-compliance with BEM-naming
-meeting deadlines

I give a guarantee for the layout (during the week all the mistakes I made will be corrected).
